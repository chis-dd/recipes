### Ingredients 
- 1 large onion
- 1 bell pepper 
- a few spicy chilli peppers (this time i used one as justyna doesnt have a great spice tolerence)
- abunch of mushrooms
- whatever vegies you have in your kitchen
- i used quorn mince in this one but i dont usually
- 1 can of kidney beans (drained and washed)
- 2 cans of black beans (drained and washed)
- 2 cans of plum tomatoes (blend beforehand as its better than chopped tomatoes)
- wine or beer
- veggie stock cube or pot
- tomato puree 
- 2 tablespoons oregano 
- 2 tablespoons cumin

- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- hot sauce of your choice except sriracha fuck sriracha (overrated) 
- butter
- bay leaves
- salt & pepper
- 4 large cloves of garlic

### Steps
- cut up veggies into smaller pieces keep separate as we added in seperate stages
- put some olive oil in a pot (large amount we aint scared of fat here)
- add a bit of onion to see when the oil gets hot
- once oil is hot add the onions, chilli flakes and slice chilli peppers to the pot, let cook for a couple of minutes until the oil turns red and the onions are slightly transuluent
- (depending on what other veggies you are using you would want to add them on seperate stages e.g potatoes take longer than carrots so potatoes should be added first and cooked until slightly done like a couple of minutes)
- add bell pepper cook for a few minutes
- add mushrooms aswell as salt and some more oil depending on how many veggies were added before
- once everything starts browning and a lot of vapour is gone
- add the garlic with a press, grated or minced
- stir and let cook for a couple of mins 
- add the spices mix well 
- give it like half a minute then add the tomato puree and stock
- let cook for another minute or two
- then once there is some browning on the bottom of the pan add either the beer or wine use more beer than wine as wine is more like a vinegar.
- add the beans
- cook off the alchol 
- add the tomatos 
- add a bit of butter and a couple of bay leaves
- simmer on low heat for atleast an hour put, a lid on if planning to cook for a longer period of time (mines i cooked for 3)
